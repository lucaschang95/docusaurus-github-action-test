## 如何创建一个 graphql 服务(service) ?

A GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing functions for each field on each type.

## 优势

1. ask for what your need, get exactly that (no more over- and under-fetching)
2. get many resources in a single request
3. describe what's possible with a type system

one resolver functin per field
