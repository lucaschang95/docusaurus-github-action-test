# 短连接与长连接

> is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair

长连接的时候：一个 TCP 连接承载多个 HTTP 请求/响应

- Connection 头部
  - Keep-Alive: 长连接
    - 客户端请求长连接
      - Connection: Keep-Alive
    - 服务器表示支持长连接
    - 客户端复用连接
    - HTTP/1.1 默认支持长连接
