# stash

> stash the changes in a dirty working directory

当你想要 record the current state of the working directory and the index, 但是 want to go back to a clean working directory.

The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.

## 场景

- 代码改完了才发现分支错了
