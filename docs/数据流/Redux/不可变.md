# 不可变 Immutability

There are several reasons why you must not mutate state in Redux:

1. It causes bugs, such as the UI not updating properly to show the latest values (model, view 不匹配)
2. It makes it harder to understand why and how the state has been updated (debug)
3. It makes it harder to write tests (debug)
4. It breaks the ability to use "time-travel debugging" correctly (debug)
5. It goes against the intended spirit and usage patterns for Redux (选择问题)
