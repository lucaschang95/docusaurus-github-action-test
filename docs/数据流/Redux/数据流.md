# 数据流 Data Flow

> "one way data flow", 遵循 MVC 原则

- actions are dispatched in response to a user interaction like a click (view -> controller)
- the store runs the reducer function to calculate a new state (controller -> model)
- the UI reads the new state to display the new values (model -> view, 通过订阅来实现)
